## Introduction
The app estimate the renewable energy based on the weather data fetched from [Weather Data API](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api).

## Running App
You can run the app by runnning [main.mlapp] in the root folder.

## Documentation
* After running the app, you have to load the weather data of the specific area in the certain period from the API. And then, you can estimate the wind energy or solar energy by the given generator.
